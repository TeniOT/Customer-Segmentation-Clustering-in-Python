# Customer Segmentation and Clustering

#### Problem Statement: 
Understand the Target Customers for the marketing team to plan a strategy

##### Context: 
The manager wants to identify the most important shopping groups based on income, age, and the mall shopping score. Preferably the ideal number of groups with a label for each category.


#### Tools: 
- Perform some quick EDA,
- Use the **KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm** to create the segments,
- Use Summary statistics to find the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clusters.
- Then visualise to identify the best marketing group.

#### Recommendations: 
**Target Cluster** 
- The target group would be **cluster 1** which has a high spending score and high income
-	60% of cluster 1 shoppers are **Female**. We should look for ways to attract these customers using a marketing campaign targeting popular items in this cluster.
-	Cluster 2 presents an interesting opportunity to market to the customers for sales events on popular items, therefore there is a need for more strategic clustering for product items in cluster 2.
-	Cluster 4 is target for ongoing marketing spend (high income and acceptable mean age).
